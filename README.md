# Clustering_Consumers_Smart_Grid_Project
Smart meter data can periodically store quantities of electricity from each consumer in the Smart Grid system.
A better understanding of consumption behaviors and
and efficient classification of consumers based on similarity of these behaviors can be useful for flexible demand management and efficient energy control.
control.
In this project, an unsupervised classification implementation is proposed to categorize consumers based on the similarity of their typical electricity consumption behaviors.
The main objective is therefore to group similar observations in order to facilitate examination of the data set. 
# Plan
This work is divided into 4 main parts:
1) Data-cleaning 
2) Data exploration/analysis
3) Clustering
4) Results analysis and interpretation
